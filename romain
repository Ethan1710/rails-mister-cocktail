# we want to add a photo attribute on a cocktail table

# 1 - create the migration
# rails g migration AddPhotoToCocktails   (in terminal)
# add_column :cocktails, :photo, :string   (add manually in migration)
# rails db:migrate  (in terminal)

# 2 - create the uploader class (gem carrierwave)
# rails g uploader PhotoUploader
# inherites from CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
# include Cloudinary::CarrierWave

# 3 - make the photo attribute an uploader
# class Cocktail < ApplicationRecord
#   mount_uploader :photo, PhotoUploader

# 4 - add photo + photo_cache input to form
# view => f.input :photo
#         f.input :photo_cache

# 5 - display image
# cl_image_tag(@cocktail.photo)
# change strong params!
